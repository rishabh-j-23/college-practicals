            </h3>

            <p>
            <p>Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the bundling
                of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, which is called a class in Java.
                Encapsulation is a way of hiding the implementation details of a class from outside access and only
                exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the class.</p>

            <p>In Java, encapsulation is achieved by declaring the instance variables of a class as private, which
                means they can only be accessed within the class. To allow outside access to the instance variables,
                public methods called getters and setters are defined, which are used to retrieve and modify the values
                of the instance variables, respectively. By using getters and setters, the class can enforce its own
                data validation rules and ensure that its internal state remains consistent.</p>

            <p>
                Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds
                together code and the data it manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is, that it is a
                protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
            </p>

            <p>
                Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class is hidden from any other class and can be
                accessed only through any member function of its own class in which it is declared.
                As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes using the data hiding concept
                which is achieved by making the members or methods of a class private, and the class is exposed to the
                end-user or the world without providing any details behind implementation using the abstraction concept,
                so it is also known as a combination of data-hiding and abstraction.
                Encapsulation can be achieved by Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public
                methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.
                It is more defined with the setter and getter method.
